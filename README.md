# ReviveWheels 🚗⚡  
*Second-Hand & Aged Vehicle Repurposing Hub*

> A full-stack platform to *resell, convert, recycle, and **donate* vehicles that would otherwise be abandoned or illegally scrapped. Built to extend the life of automobiles and promote clean, legal, and impactful transportation.

## 💡 Problem We're Solving

India bans 10–15 year old vehicles in major cities, leaving millions of cars stranded. Most are either:
- Scrapped unethically
- Left abandoned on roads
- Or illegally sold without tracking

*ReviveWheels* steps in with a circular economy approach — enabling:
- Legal resale of aged vehicles
- EV conversions through verified workshops
- Responsible recycling of unusable parts
- Donations to NGOs and rural services

## 🎯 Why This Matters

✅ *Social Impact* – Reduces pollution and vehicle abandonment  
✅ *Eco-friendly* – Promotes EV adoption and recycling  
✅ *Legality* – Enforces verified ownership transfers and scrapping  
✅ *Affordability* – Gives low-income buyers access to vehicles  
✅ *Scalable* – Works across cities, states, and eventually countries
