ReviveWheels – Second-Hand & Aged Vehicle Repurposing Hub

💡 Concept

ReviveWheels is a platform designed to help buy, sell, repurpose, or recycle old and banned vehicles. Instead of being abandoned or scrapped illegally, vehicles can be resold, converted to electric, or dismantled sustainably.

🚀 Why This Idea?

✅ Solves a Growing Problem – Many cities ban vehicles older than 10-15 years due to pollution norms.

✅ Eco-Friendly – Encourages recycling, resale, and EV conversion instead of junking vehicles.

✅ Market Need – High demand for affordable second-hand cars, bike parts, and EV conversions.

✅ Government Interest – Aligns with India's scrappage policy and green mobility initiatives.

🔹 Key Features

4️⃣ Used Spare Parts Store – Buy and sell used engines, batteries, tires, and other spare parts from scrapped vehicles.

6️⃣ Carpooling & Donation – Facilitate donations of old vehicles for rural transport, NGOs, or carpooling services.
